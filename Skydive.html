			<h1 style="color:blue;"> Skydiving Page</h1>
			<p>I got into skydiving because it was something that was on my bucket list; I went to do a tandem jump just to experience it. My friend went with me, but she couldn't jump because she was seventeen. Technically, she wasn't supposed to ride up in the plane either (due to parachute laws requiring the user to be at least eighteen), but they allowed her to go up with me anyway so she could take cool pictures and a video of me jumping out.</p>
			<p>After the jump, I still had so much adrenaline. They asked me if I would try it again and I told them I would come back in a month or two to do another tandem. That's when they told me about a program called AFF (Accelerated Free Fall), and that if I took a six hour class and passed seven levels (each level was meant to teach you new skills/how to do tricks in the sky; you needed to do well enough in a level at which your instructor feels comfortable enough to let you jump without one or two instructors jumping next to you). I told them I'd think about it, but it was an expensive process and I wasn't sure if I would be interested in it enough. I pretty much decided I wasn't going to go through with it, but a few days later at work, I began considering it again and decided that, without a doubt, I was going to make it happen. I called the drop zone in my state to get more information to me, and a lady explained to me what each level teaches you and how much they cost. She assured me that it is common to fail at least one level, but you'd have to repay the whole cost to retry the level. She also explained something called relaxed jumps, which are slightly cheaper jumps than the level ones, and are designed to let you practice what you have to be able to do in the next level, but without being tested on ability. This was comforting enough for me to ask her what days I can take the class. I then asked people around work until I found someone who could take my shift on the next Sunday.</p>
			<p>Long story short, I passed the class. It was over in the afteroon, and I was able to take my first test after it. I had to wait hours to go because there were many other students in the class with me who were jumping before me, and I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to jump because it looked like there was a storm coming through. By the time it was my turn, I was able to go. It was and is the prettiest jump I've experienced; the sun was setting right over the already pretty lake (I didn't notice this during free fall, as it was a rough fall, but I was enjoying it while I was under canopy, coming back down slowly to the ground.</p>
			<p>I failed my first jump (not a very good start). I was so nervous that I forgot to do one of the most important tasks in the jump: I forgot to keep my head up when I let go of the strut. Instead, I had my head down, causing me to start off spinning, and I had no idea how to gain stability (we learned how to do it in the class, but it turns out it's not easy to figure out on your first jump while spinning and doing continuous, uncontrollable flips at about one hundred miles an hour). As a result, one instructor had to let go of me because they couldn't hold on; as for my other instructor, I thought I had kicked him in the head (he told me later that I didn't kick him), so I decided to signal (by waving my hands in front of my head a couple of times) that I was going to deploy, as I needed to pull by 5000 feet above the ground but I was spinning so fast that I couldn't read my altimeter. My instructor let me go and got away from me and I deployed. It turned out that it was super early (it felt like I had been falling forever), but they told me later that they were glad I pulled my parachute when I realized I couldn't fix my situation. I had a radio in my helmet in which someone on the ground was giving me instructions on how to land. It ended up being an amazing landing; still my best landing of all of my jumps. This didn't usually happen the first time people land, so it gave me the confidence to come back despite my frustration of having failed the first level.</p>
			<p>I learned from my mistake and continued through the levels. There were a couple of levels I barely passed, and I failed level four twice. Finally, though, I passed the last level and was able to land without a radio telling me what to do. I then went up for my first solo jump, which was extremely peaceful. I went on one more jump with another person, who took the pictures at the bottom of the page for me. I had asked him to try to get pictures with the sunset in the background, but I still wasn't experienced enough to be able to be in the right spot. I was also spinning a lot, and I have an issue with my arms; I can't seem to position them the right way, so they're all flanky and it makes me unstable. My very last jump before I ended my season and came to college was another solo, in which I couldn't stop spinning.</p>
			<p>I'm definitely planning on going back this summer; I ended last summer with 14 jumps. I need to be more economical about it, however, as I drained my bank account right before coming to college last summer. I want to go to an air tunnel first so I can practice fixing my arm position and staying stable before I go back and do the real thing. I then want to work on mastering tricks over the summer so I can successfully jump with other people without messing it up by spinning, and be able to do tricks with them. I also want to become more familiar with feeling the diection of the wind; last summer, I accidentally landed with the wind which is dangerous to do when you're still learning, and I took a hard tumble upon landing. I was sore for days afterwards, so that's something I want to prevent from happening again. I wanted to build up my jump numbers and increase my skills so that I could get my skydiving license. Before I do any of this, though, I have to jump with an instructor next to me to perform another level to show I'm still safe to jump by myself. Another goal I have for the upcoming summer is to learn how to pack a parachute; for each parachute you pack, you get $15 off your cost of jumps. Plus, it would be cool to know how to pack my own parachute instead of relying on other people to pack it for me. I tried to learn last summer but I just wasn't doing it right. With it being the end of the summer, I decided to give up until this next summer. Someday I hope to have even cooler pictures, and get my own equipment and helmet/GoPro to capture amazing videos.</p>
