			<h1 style="color:red; font-size:24;"> Nicole Ashe</h1>
			<p>My name is Nicole Ashe, and I'm a student at UMO. I'm majoring in business management with a minor in leadership studies. I'm hoping to possibly pick up another major and/or one or two more minors. I'm originally from a small town in Vermont called Williamstown, but I came to UMaine because I wanted to get away from the place I've lived for my entire life and gain some independence without going too far from home.</p>
			<p>I have a lot of passions and hobbies, as well. These include creative writing and hiking, to name the main ones. One of my favorite hobbies during the summer include skydiving.</p>
			<p>Here is a link to a skydiving page, where I will discuss how I got into it, the process I went through for it, where I am now/where I want to get to in the future, as well as a few pictures from my experiences: <a href="Skydive.html"> My Experiences</a>.</p>
			<p>I'm also a huge fan of dogs; I have two dogs of my own at home.</p>
			<p>Here is a link to my page about my dogs! I have included some information about them, as well as some pictures! <a href="My Dogs.html"> My Dogs</a>. </p>
			<p>Finally, I have some information about my life at college as well. A huge part of my college experience is the friendships I've made. I've made a lot of friends at college!</p>
			<p>Here is a link to see some of them, including pictures and information about them! <a href="My College Friends.html"> My College Friends</a>. </p>
