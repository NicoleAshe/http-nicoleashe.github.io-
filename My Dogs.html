    <h1>My Dogs</h1>
<p> I don't remember many times in my childhood in which my family didn't have a dog; it was mostly just the relatively short periods between dogs. I vaguely remember having a dog who died of age, and another dog who we had to get rid of due to him trying to bite my baby brother.</p>
</p>In one of our times without a dog, I had said to my parents that I wanted to get another dog. One day, my dad took my older brother and I into the field next to our house to hang out. He told us we needed to stay there for a little bit, because my mom and younger brother had a surprise for us that they were getting ready. I jokingly asked if it was a dog, and my dad sternly told me no. However, when we got back to our house, there my mom and brother were, holding a boxer puppy. Somehow I got the priviledge to pick the name; I named him Sammy. Sammy, being a boxer, was a very happy, hyper, and destructive dog. One of my favorite memories with him is having his sister over for a playdate (she was even more naughty, as she peed all over the floors) and taking him to "dog school" to play with other dogs but also be trained on some basic dog skills.</p>

<p>Not too long later, my parents decided to get a dog from the rescue center. One dog in particular caught the eyes of my little brother and I, and we ended up taking a pre-named dog named Krystal who had been abused by her owner and was rescued from a flood. We still don't know what breed she is; she is definitely a mix of a few things. Krystal became my best friend; she protected me, including growling at anyone she didn't trust around me, or if she thought someone who was trying to mess with me was actually trying to hurt me). She would sleep with me every single night. One time, I went to summer camp for a week. My mom sent me a letter, as there was no service, and told me that Krystal would wait by my bedroom door every night waiting for me to let her in, and would eventually give up and go to bed, sad and confused. It broke and warmed my heart at the same time. Another time, my parents made me record our phone message, and sometimes I would hide somewehere and call the house phone and bring it to the voicemail. Krystal would hear it and would wine as she ran around the house until she found me, and she would get so happy. It was the cutest thing ever.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of my little brother, Krystal, and myself the day we got her.<p>

<p>Sammy and Krystal are best friends now; Krystal bullies him, but it's obvious they wouldn't know what to do without each other. They're both getting a little old; we're specifcally worried about Sammy, as boxers don't usually live too long anyway. I'm emotionally preparing myself to deal with two difficult losses of my childhood and my family, but for now they are a huge part of my excitement each time I come home from college.</p> 
<p>Here are some pictures of the both of them.</p>
