    <h1>My College Friends</h1>
	<p>Like most high school girls, I had my fair share of drama between friends, and went through many processes of losing some friends and gaining others. I heard people say many times that I'll meet my true friends in college. I didn't really believe that until I came to college myself.</p>
	<p>The people I consider my main friends have all been there for me at some point, in one way or the other, in the six months that I've known them. I met my friends, the ones I consider family (we call ourselves the "OxSquad") in my dorm building within the first week of being here, and we've all been extremely close ever since.</p>
	<p>Here is a picture of the "OxSquad". One person in the group cycled out, and there are a few people in our "family" not in the photo. I organized this photo to celebrate October 3rd, AKA Mean Girl's Day (if you've seen the movie, Mean Girls, you know what it means). After that, I'll highlight some of my closest friends.</p>

	<h1>Lindsey</h1>
	<p>Lindsey is my roommate. I took a risk getting a random roommate for this year, and having heard plenty of stories of nightmare roommates, I was extremely nervous. However, we ended up being pretty similar people, and we developed a connection in both being nervous to start college and make friends. Now I consider her one of my best friends and we hang out all the time. It's like having a sister, which is nice because I've always wanted a sister. Every time we leave for breaks, we always look forward to coming back to see each other. We were supposed to get an apartment together next year, but she unfortuately decided to transfer to USM next year. As sad as I am, I have no doubt that we will continue our friendship.</p>

	<h1>Andrew</h1>
	<p>I'm a month older than Andrew, but I pretty much consider him an older brother. My roommate and I met him along with some of the other boys during the welcome week of the first semester in the common room of our dorm. We played uno with them, and Andrew was extremely funny and outgoing; it was easy to befriend him. Now we have an apartment leased together with another friend for next year. He's done a lot for me, including doing favors when I need them and hanging out with me all the time. He's become a friend I consider family.</p>

	<h1>Connor</h1>
	<p>Connor is Andrew's roommate, and I also met him at the uno game. He's also become just like a brother to me like Andrew. He's the other friend that I will be living with next year. He's been really helpful to me with homework and he always gives me great advice. I hang out in him and Andrew's room with them all the time. </p>

	<h1>Jesse</h1>
	<p>I also met Jesse during the uno game, and we became really good friends. One time I had a flat tire at a gas station and I posted it in our group chat asking for advice, because there was a giant hole in my tire and I didn't know how to change it. Jesse found a ride to me and he changed my tire for me. He's also stayed up with me on nights that I was up most of the night doing homework in our study room, just so I had company. For Christmas, we did Secret Santa, and he was mine. He gave me a wood carving that said "OxFam". The authenticity meant a lot to me. I have a lot of respect for Jesse.</p>

	<h1>Patrick</h1>
	<p>Patrick is Jesse's roommate, and I also met him at the uno game. We hang out a lot on the weekends, and he's a friend I know I can always go to for comfort and advice.</p>

	<h1>Josh</h1>
	<p>Josh entered the friend group a little later on. We used to hang out in our study room together all the time and Josh started hanging out with us. He was really shy and quiet and we opened him up. Now he's one of my favorite people. He hangs out with my roommate and I all the time and spoils us; sometimes he'll show up with our favorite Starbucks drinks. For Valentine's Day, he brought me and my roommate Starbucks and a coffee mug with a stuffed animal inside. He's always there for us, and that's why he's so special to me.</p>

	<h1>Andrea and Ethan</h1>
	<p>I met Ethan playing uno as well. He was a good friend to the start. The second weekend I was at school, I got sick and stayed in bed all day. Ethan came in late in the day to hang out with me since I was all alone, and after hearing my stomach growl, he convinced me to come get some food since I hadn't eaten all day long. I became even closer with him from the club we joined together, Campus Activities Board. While there, we both became friends with another member of the club, Andrea. All three of us went to represent CAB in Connecticut at an event called NACA, where we watched performers to see what we want to bring back to campus. We all became really close there, and now they're the main reasons I look forward to the CAB meetings each week.</p>

	<h1>My sorority sisters</h1>
	<p>I joined a sorority during my first semester with the hopes of making new friends, and I got my wish. I'm not close with all of the girls, but there's a good amount of girls I really consider my sisters now and I always look forward to strenghtening those friendships and building new ones with other girls.</p>
